**Project Idea: E-commerce Platform**

An e-commerce platform caters to several functionalities â€“ user management, product management, order management, recommendations, reviews, and analytics, among others. These functionalities make it a suitable candidate for both monolithic and microservices architectures.

**Monolithic Development**:

1. **Design & Planning**:
    * **User Cases & UML**: Identify key entities - users, products, orders, reviews, etc. Sketch their interactions and relationships.
    * **API Specification**: Using OpenAPI (or alternatives) to define your API endpoints for CRUD operations and other functionalities.
    * **Postman Collections**: Create collections for testing all the APIs with mock data.

2. **Backend Development**:
    * Set up a Kotlin Spring Boot 2 project using Gradle.
    * Implement the clean architecture or Onion architecture to keep your code decoupled and maintainable.
    * Use coroutines for asynchronous operations, especially beneficial for IO operations.
    * Implement data access using MyBatis and HSQLDB.
    * Set up authentication using OAuth.
    * Implement health checks using Spring Actuator.
    * Write unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito.

3. **Monitoring & Operations**:
    * Containerize the application using Docker.
    * Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
    * Optionally use Ansible for automation and Vault for secrets management.
    * ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and log analysis.

**Transition to Microservices**:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**:
    * Identify bounded contexts. For example, User Management, Product Management, Order Management can each be a context.
    * Implement database per service pattern. Use Liquibase for database versioning and migrations.

2. **Strangling the Monolith**:
    * Start the transition by identifying parts of the application that are more suited for a microservices architecture or are high-load, e.g., order management.
    * Use Kubernetes for orchestration.

3. **Communication & Events**:
    * Implement gRPC for internal communication among microservices.
    * Set up Kafka streams for event-driven architecture. This aligns well with Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Saga patterns which can be leveraged for distributed transactions and ensuring data consistency across microservices.
    * Implement API Gateway for external-facing communication.
    * Optionally consider GraphQL for a more flexible API.

4. **Service Resilience & Observability**:
    * Istio as a service mesh can provide functionalities like circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and more.
    * Log aggregation to centralize logs from all microservices.
    * Distributed tracing to trace requests as they pass through different services.
    * Service discovery using tools like Kubernetes itself, Consul, or cloud-native solutions like AWS Service Discovery.

5. **Advanced Patterns**:
    * Sidecar patterns (using tools like Istio) can be utilized for cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, security, etc.
    * Event sourcing to store the state of entities as a sequence of events.

6. **Deployment & Scalability**:
    * Use Kubernetes for deploying microservices.
    * Ensure each microservice has its own scalable infrastructure.
